# BinBot
A small python script to scrape the public pastebin archive and optionally filter by keywords.

This version of BinBot was ported from a personal version, so there may be small code irregularities that don't effect functionality.

**Planned Features:**

* Pastebin API support
* Re-implementing the random URL generation function and proxy chain
